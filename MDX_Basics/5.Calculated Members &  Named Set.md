# CALCULATED MEMBERS & NAMED SETS

## CALCULATED MEMBERS
---

Steps in Visual studio and others..

### QUERY SCOPED CALCULATED MEMBER
---

Query scoped calculated members are defined and used along with the MDX query

For example :

In the below example, `[Measures].[InternetProfit]` is a calculated member which is defined and executed along with rest of the MDX query

```mdx
WITH MEMBER [Measures].[InternetProfit] AS
[Measures].[Internet Sales Amount]-[Measures].[Internet Total Product Cost]

SELECT
[Measures].[InternetProfit] ON COLUMNS,
[Sales Territory].[Sales Territory Country].[Sales Territory Country] ON ROWS

FROM
[Adventure Works]
```

### SESSION SCOPED CALCULATED MEMBER
---

Session scoped calculated members are created first and then can be used in any number of queries of the current session.

>***Session :***
    As long as we are performing operations in the same MDX script file, we are inside a session and upon creating a new MDX query script, we jump into another session.

To create a session scoped calculated member, we have to follow the simillar syntax as below and execute it.

```mdx
CREATE MEMBER [Adventure Works].[Measures].[SessionInternetProfit] AS
[Measures].[Internet Sales Amount]-[Measures].[Internet Total Product Cost]
```
***Notes :*** *Cube name must be provided before defining the session scoped calculated member*

After creating the above session scoped calculated member, we can simply comment it out so that, we don't lose the calculated member name and its formula and then, we can query the cube any number of time within the same session by using the created session scoped calculated member.

An example of using the session scoped calculated member is :

```mdx
SELECT
[Measures].[SessionInternetProfit] ON COLUMNS,
[Sales Territory].[Sales Territory Country].[Sales Territory Country] ON ROWS

FROM
[Adventure Works]
```
### CREATING MUTIPLE CALCULATED MEMBER AT ONCE
---
We can also create mutiple calculated members (query scoped/session scoped) at once, as follows :

```mdx
WITH MEMBER [Measures].[InternetProfit] AS
[Measures].[Internet Sales Amount]-[Measures].[Internet Total Product Cost]

MEMBER [Measures].[ProfitPct] AS
[Measures].[InternetProfit]/[Measures].[Internet Sales Amount],
FORMAT_STRING = 'Percent'

SELECT
{
	[Measures].[InternetProfit],
	[Measures].[ProfitPct]
}
ON COLUMNS,

[Sales Territory].[Sales Territory Country].[Sales Territory Country] ON ROWS

FROM
[Adventure Works]
```

In the above formula, we have created 2 query scoped calculated members and for the 2nd calculated member, we don't have to write `WITH` before `MEMBER`.

Similarly, we needed to show the `Profit` in percentages and therefore, we have assigned `Percent` for the `FORMAT_STRING` argument.

## NAMED SET
---

Steps in Visual studio and others..

### QUERY SCOPED NAMED SET
---

Query scoped named set are defined and used along with the MDX query

For example :

In the below example, `[Year2012Onwards]` is a named set which is defined and executed along with rest of the MDX query

```mdx
WITH SET [Year2012Onwards] AS
[Ship Date].[Calendar Year].&[2012]:
[Ship Date].[Calendar Year].&[2014]

SELECT
[Measures].[Sales Amount]
ON COLUMNS,
[Year2012Onwards]
ON ROWS

FROM
[Adventure Works]
```
### SESSION SCOPED NAMED SET
---

Session scoped named set are created first and then can be used in any number of queries of the current session.

>***Session :***
    As long as we are performing operations in the same MDX script file, we are inside a session and upon creating a new MDX query script, we jump into another session.

To create a session scoped named set, we have to follow the simillar syntax as below and execute it.

```mdx
CREATE SET [Adventure Works].[Year2012Onwards] AS
[Ship Date].[Calendar Year].&[2012]:
[Ship Date].[Calendar Year].&[2014]
```
***Notes :*** *Cube name must be provided before defining the session scoped named set*

After creating the above session scoped named set, we can simply comment it out so that, we don't lose the named set name and its formula and then, we can query the cube any number of time within the same session by using the created session scoped named set.

An example of using the session scoped calculated member is :

```mdx
SELECT
[Measures].[Sales Amount]
ON COLUMNS,
[Year2012Onwards]
ON ROWS

FROM
[Adventure Works]
```

## ORDER SET
---

This is used to sort the set based on a measure value.

For example :

If we want to sort the countries based on the `Sales Amount` in ascending or, descending order then, we can use the order set.

The syntax for doing so is :

> ORDER (set/attribute to sort, sort by measure, asc/desc)

Let's see how we can sort the countries in desending order of `Sales Amount`

```mdx
SELECT
[Measures].[Sales Amount]
ON COLUMNS,
ORDER
(
	[Sales Territory].[Sales Territory Country].[Sales Territory Country],
	[Measures].[Sales Amount],
	DESC
)
ON ROWS

FROM
[Adventure Works]
```

To see only the Top 5 countirs based on `Sales Amount` we can use the `HEAD()` function with `ORDER()`, as follows :

```mdx
SELECT
[Measures].[Sales Amount]
ON COLUMNS,
HEAD(
	ORDER
	(
		[Sales Territory].[Sales Territory Country].[Sales Territory Country],
		[Measures].[Sales Amount],
		DESC
	),5
)
ON ROWS

FROM
[Adventure Works]
```
## TOPCOUNT()
---

Insetad of using `HEAD()` and `ORDER()` togather to get the top 5 counties by a measure, we can use a single function, called `TOPCOUNT()`.

The syntax of the function is as follows :

> TOPCOUNT(set/attribute to sort, n , sort by measure) 

Let's see how we can get top 5 countries by a measure using `TOPCOUNT()` :

```mdx
SELECT
[Measures].[Sales Amount]
ON COLUMNS,
TOPCOUNT
(
	[Sales Territory].[Sales Territory Country].[Sales Territory Country],
	5,
	[Measures].[Sales Amount]	
)
ON ROWS

FROM
[Adventure Works]
```
We can also optimize (reducing code complexity and making it more readable) the code by, using the `TOPCOUNT()` function in a named set as follows :

```mdx
WITH SET [Top5Country] AS
TOPCOUNT
(
	[Sales Territory].[Sales Territory Country].[Sales Territory Country],
	5,
	[Measures].[Sales Amount]	
)

SELECT
[Measures].[Sales Amount]
ON COLUMNS,
[Top5Country]
ON ROWS

FROM
[Adventure Works]
```
